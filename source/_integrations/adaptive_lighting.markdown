The `adaptive_lighting` platform changes the settings of your lights throughout the day.
It uses the position of the sun to calculate the color temperature and brightness that is most fitting for that time of the day.
Scientific research has shown that this helps to maintain your natural circadian rhythm (your biological clock) and might lead to improved sleep, mood, and general well-being.

In practical terms, this means that after the sun sets, the brightness of your lights will decrease to a certain minimum brightness, while the color temperature will be at its coolest color temperature at noon, after which it will decrease and reach its warmest color at sunset.
Around sunrise, the opposite will happen.

Additionally, the integration provides a way to define and set your lights in "sleep mode".
When "sleep mode" is enabled, the lights will be at a minimal brightness and have a very warm color.

The integration creates two switches.
The first switch `switch.adaptive_lighting_default` (with name `"default"`) turns the Adaptive Lighting on or off.
It has several attributes that show the current light settings.
The second switch is `switch.adaptive_lighting_sleep_mode_default` (with name `"default"`) that when activated, turns on "sleep mode".

## Taking back control

Although having your lights automatically adapt is great most of the time, there might be times at which you want to set the lights to a different color/brightness and keep it that way.
For this purpose, the integration (when `take_over_control` is enabled) automatically detects whether someone (e.g., person toggling the light switch) or something (automation) changes the lights.
If this happens *and* the light is already on, the light that was changed gets marked as "manually controlled" and the Adaptive Lighting component will stop adapting that light until it turns off and on again (or if you use the service call `adaptive_lighting.set_manual_control`).
This mechanism works by listening to all `light.turn_on` calls and by noting that the component did not make the call.
Additionally, there is an option to detect all state changes (when `detect_non_ha_changes` is enabled), so also changes to the lights that were not made by a `light.turn_on` call (e.g., through an app or via something not controlled by Home Assistant.)
It does this by comparing a light's state to Adaptive Lighting's previously used settings.
Whenever a light gets marked as "manually controlled", an `adaptive_lighting.manual_control` event is fired, such that one can use this information in automations.

## Configuration

This integration is both fully configurable through YAML _and_ the frontend. (**Configuration** -> **Integrations** -> **Adaptive Lighting**, **Adaptive Lighting** -> **Options**)
Here, the options in the frontend and in YAML have the same names.
